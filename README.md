# Waste Manifests proof of concept

This is a proof of concept web application that demonstrates the use of web technologies to modernize internal apps at Environment. The Environmental Protection and Assessment branchâ€™s Waste Manifest app was chosen for this demonstration. This app is used to track [Special Waste Manifests](https://yukon.ca/en/get-special-waste-permit).

>Waste Manifests, sometimes referred to as Movement Documents, are official documents that accompany shipments of special/hazardous waste in Yukon and other Canadian jurisdictions from their origin to their destination. They document information on: 
>* the waste generator (consignor)
>* the waste carrier (transporter)
>* the waste receiver (consignee) 
>* the waste being shipped
>
>All special/hazardous wastes transported in Yukon must be accompanied by a manifest.
